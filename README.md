My SvelteKit Project
This repository is the outcome of my learning and practice with SvelteKit, a modern web development framework. I followed a comprehensive tutorial and covered a range of topics from initializing a new project to handling API requests.

Live Demo
A live demo of this project is available here on Vercel.https://vercel.com/matthieugriffon/tuto-svelkit

What I Learned
Introduction: Understanding SvelteKit and its main features.

Project Initialization: How to initialize a new project and create a first "Hello World" application.

Routing: Learning the routing system in SvelteKit, including how to define and use routes.

Nested and Dynamic Routes: Creating nested and dynamic routes for more complex application organization.

Route Management: How to use "Catch All" routes, optional parameters, and navigation tools to handle requests and navigate between pages.

Layout and Organization: Understanding layout concepts, layout groups, and how to "escape" from layouts for pages that require a unique layout.

API and Request Handling: Introduction to creating APIs with SvelteKit and how to handle different types of requests (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE).

Data Loading: Learning to load external data and use page-specific data in SvelteKit.

Loading Functions: Using universal and server loading functions to load data, and comparing between the two.

Data and Error Handling: Understanding how to extract and use data from URLs, handle errors and redirections, and use layout data.

Promises and Data Invalidation: Learning to handle promises in SvelteKit and invalidate data to ensure consistency.

Preloading and Link Options: Understanding the different link options in SvelteKit, how to preload data and code, and manage page reloading and scrolling.

Page Options and Prerendering: Exploring the different options available to customize pages and how to prerender pages for better performance.

Server Side Rendering vs Client Side Rendering: Comparing server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) and discussing their pros and cons.
